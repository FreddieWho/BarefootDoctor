# A Barefoot Doctor's Manual

《赤脚医生手册》数字化计划

---

Barefoot doctors are rural healthcare workers who typically lack formal medical training but possess a blend of agricultural and medical knowledge. In the 1960s, Mao Zedong proposed the "barefoot doctor" initiative in response to significant healthcare disparities between urban and rural areas. The Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China then promoted this initiative, which gradually evolved into a widespread and crucial national project. Through measures such as creating foundational textbooks and deploying trained medical personnel to rural regions, this project substantially enhanced the health conditions of numerous rural residents during a period of precarious economic and industrial development. It notably contributed to a significant increase in average life expectancy and represented a remarkable practical undertaking in the fields of medicine and public health.

"A Barefoot Doctor's Manual" stands as one of the most exemplary and successful outcomes of the "barefoot doctor" project. This book diverges from the conventional medical education approach, which typically begins with foundational theories, by directly addressing prevalent diseases and health risks in underdeveloped regions. It explores strategies to maximize medical benefits while operating within the constraints of severely limited resources. Through studying the "Manual," even farmers without any prior medical or biological knowledge can swiftly grasp diagnostic and treatment methods for common illnesses, as well as understand preventive measures for health hazards. Although barefoot doctors lacked systematic professional training and faced scarcity of essential supplies, their medical expertise may have been deemed insufficient by trained physicians. Nonetheless, it cannot be denied that barefoot doctors played a vital role in safeguarding the health of millions of impoverished rural individuals.

As the economy has progressed, the era of barefoot doctors in China has gradually come to an end. However, in numerous underdeveloped regions around the world, due to the shortage of medical industrial products and professional medical personnel, people still face difficulties that the "Manual" was designed to solve. From this perspective, this medical textbook from half a century ago retains its relevance (perhaps politicians should feel ashamed of this). Sadly, the "Manual" has become outdated and lacks comprehensive online resources. Hence, the objective of this project is to undertake the task of retranslating and organizing the "Manual" to enhance its accessibility, thereby aiding those people in need of its guidance.

赤脚医生指一般未经正式医疗训练、“半农半医”的农村医疗人员。20世纪60年代，囿于巨大的城乡医疗水平差异，由毛泽东提出，中华人民共和国卫生部推进，“赤脚医生”逐渐发展为一项广泛的，重要的国家工程。这项工程通过编写基础教材，向农村输送专业医疗人员等措施，在那个经济和工业基础高度薄弱的年代极大地改善了数量巨大的农村居民的卫生条件，显著地提高了人均寿命，是医学和公共卫生学的一次伟大的实践。

《赤脚医生手册》是“赤脚医生”工程最典型，最成功的成果之一。本书抛弃了从基础理论开始的传统医学教育的流程，直接就欠发达地区常见的疾病和卫生危害展开，讨论如何利用极为有限的资源实现最大的医疗收益。通过阅读《手册》，无任何医学和生物学基础的农民也可以在很短的时间内掌握常见疾病的诊疗方法和卫生危害的防治。由于缺乏系统性的专业培训和物资的匮乏，赤脚医生的医疗水平在专业的医生看来也许是不合格的。但不可否认的是，赤脚医生曾经守护了数以千万计的农村贫困人口的健康。

随着经济的发展，赤脚医生已经在中国退出历史舞台。但是，在世界上很多欠发达地区，人们仍然面临着医疗工业品专业医疗人员短缺的困境，这正是《手册》希望解决的问题。从这个角度而言，这本半个世纪前的医学教材仍未过时（或许政治家们应当为此感到羞愧）。《手册》在互联网上资料匮乏陈旧，本项目希望将《手册》进行重新翻译整理，让《手册》以更易得地方式帮助到需要它的人民。
