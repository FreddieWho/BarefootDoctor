    Translating 'A Barefoot Doctor’s Manual' and refine


---

Barefoot doctors refer to rural medical personnel who lack formal medical training and are half-farmer and half-doctor. In the 1960s, due to the huge disparity in medical standards between urban and rural areas, Mao Zedong proposed and the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China promoted the "barefoot doctor" program, which gradually developed into a widespread and important national program. This program greatly improved the health conditions of a large number of rural residents and significantly increased life expectancy through measures such as writing basic textbooks and sending professional medical personnel to rural areas in an era of extreme industrial and economic weakness.

The Barefoot Doctor's Manual is one of the most typical and successful results of the "barefoot doctor" program. The book abandons the traditional medical education process starting from basic theory and directly discusses common diseases and health hazards in underdeveloped areas, exploring how to achieve maximum medical benefits with extremely limited resources. By reading the Manual, even farmers with no medical or biological foundation can quickly learn about the diagnosis and treatment of common diseases and the prevention and control of health hazards.

With the development of the economy, barefoot doctors have faded into history in China. Even so, due to the shortage of medical industrial products and professional medical personnel in many underdeveloped areas around the world, people still face difficulties that barefoot doctors were designed to solve. From this perspective, this medical textbook from half a century ago is still relevant (perhaps politicians should feel ashamed of this). Unfortunately, the Manual has become obsolete due to a lack of updated information on the internet. Therefore, this project aims to retranslate and organize the Manual to make it more accessible to those people who need it.

赤脚医生指一般未经正式医疗训练、“半农半医”的农村医疗人员。20世纪60年代，囿于巨大的城乡医疗水平差异，由毛泽东提出，中华人民共和国卫生部推进，“赤脚医生”逐渐发展为一项广泛的，重要的国家工程。这项工程通过编写基础教材，向农村输送专业医疗人员等措施，在那个经济和工业基础高度薄弱的年代极大地改善了数量巨大的农村居民的卫生条件，显著地提高了人均寿命，是医学和公共卫生学的一次伟大的实践。
《赤脚医生手册》是“赤脚医生”工程最典型，最成功的成果之一。本书抛弃了从基础理论开始的传统医学教育的流程，直接就欠发达地区常见的疾病和卫生危害展开，讨论如何利用极为有限的资源实现最大的医疗收益。通过阅读《手册》，无任何医学和生物学基础的农民也可以在很短的时间内掌握常见疾病的诊疗方法和卫生危害的防治。
随着经济的发展，赤脚医生已经在中国退出历史舞台，甚至，由于通常性的经验主义和缺乏理论知识的特点，赤脚医生在中国演变成了对缺乏专业教育的经验主义者的概称。但是，在世界上很多欠发达地区，人们仍然面临着医疗工业品短缺和专业医疗人员短缺的困境，这正是《手册》希望解决的问题。从这个角度而言，这本半个世纪前的医学教材仍未过时（或许政治家们应当为此感到羞愧）。
《手册》在互联网上资料匮乏陈旧，本项目希望将《手册》进行重新翻译整理，让《手册》以更易得地方式帮助到需要它的人民。
